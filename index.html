                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps">DevOps</a> is the
                intersection of software development, systems operations
                management, and quality assurance. The successful DevOps
                engineer has the skills of a system architect, a coder,
                a sys admin, a QA tester, a network engineer, and more.

                    'In speaking with his colleagues and representatives from
                    various enterprises, Kalache continually confirmed that
                    organizations using DevOps are in need of lots of engineers
                    but they can't find candidates who are knowledgeable and
                    experienced. "I was actually recruiting for SlideShare and
                    for LinkedIn. What saddened me was to see a graduate who
                    had just spent half a decade and a lot of money on a
                    master's degree only to be far from employable," he says.'

                <ul>
                    <li> There's definitely something very, very real about devops
                        - eliminating that impedence mismatch between
                        ops and engineering is powerful.
                    <li> Most engineers don't have the skills
                        necessary so there is a need for it
                    <li> A huge amount of devops is really learning to adjust
                        your way of thinking to the cloud and not let
                        classical thinking on traditional sys admin dominate your brain
                    <li> AWS's free options might give a compelling toolkit
                        for your students; the best contact at AWS
                        for help is Jeff Barr who's their evangelist. 
                        If you push further with this I can likely give you an introduction
                    <li> Cost control on devops is a very real thing;
                        just covering cost management in the cloud is a viable topic.
                    <li><b>Overall I think it's a great idea</b>.
